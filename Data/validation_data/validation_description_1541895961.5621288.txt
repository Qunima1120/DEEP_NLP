Homozygous VRC01 transgenic mouse
Protocols: Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 71Mb
Genomic DNA obtained from normal skin of patient number 5 for exome sequencing analysis
Protocols: For each sample, 50-60 mg grey matter was dissected and immediately added to 1 ml Trizol reagent and the total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen); poly-A containing mRNA was purified from total RNA using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Illumina)
Protocols: Total RNA was extracted with GenElute total RNA miniprep kit, treated with turbo DNase and purified with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit. The quality was assessed on a bioanalyzer. ES cells were cultured in DMEM with GlutaMax (Life technologies) containing 15% FCS and LIF Libraries were prepared with Truseq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold Prep kit (Illumina). Lipofectamine RNAi MAX (Life technologies) were used to transfect siRNA.

Protocols: MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagle's medium 'DMEM' (Invitrogen).  Media were supplemented with and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were incubated for 24 hours in an In vivo2 Hypoxia Work Station (Ruskin Technologies) in an atmosphere of either normoxia (21% oxygen) or hypoxia (0.5% oxygen). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described in the paper. Libraries were prepared using the Illumina ChIP-Seq kit.

ChIP-seq, Read length 75nt PE, KAPA Library Prep Kit, Number of PCR cycles 0 cycles, Amount of DNA used to make to libraries: ~20ng, 4 samples were multiplexed per lane.
Patient was symptomatic since 8 years of age with icterus, recurring jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, massive spenomegaly and reticulocytosis. Peripheral blood smear revealed many RBCs to be stomatocytes (~20-30%) and reticulocytes count was 25 % . Hematological findings were suggestive of congenital stomatocytosis with compensated hemolytic anemia.
